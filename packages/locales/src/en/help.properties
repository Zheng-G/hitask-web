With a Team account you can do that. Simply add Participants using the select list just below the first Assignee.<br/>\

<img src="img/help/complete01.png"/>\
Completed items appear in the <i>Completed</i> group at the bottom of your list.\

<img src="img/help/subtasks3.png"/>\



emailtask.p1=\
You can create tasks by sending emails to Hitask.<br><br>\
Sometimes it's easier to email a task in. For example, if you are adding tasks from a mobile phone or PDA while your're on the move.<br>\You can also integrate Hitask's with your website, or another system that sends you an automated emails, so those emails automatically turn into new tasks.<br>

emailtask.h2=How to send
emailtask.p2=\
Simply send an email to <b>[your user name]</b>@hitask.com, where <b>[your user name]</b> is the username that you use to log in to Hitask.<br>\
For example, if you use "joe" as your username then you should send the task to <b>joe</b>@Hitask.com.<br>\
The subject of the email message will be the title of the task, and any text in the email message will become the task description.<br>\
<br>\
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> The email message must be "From:" an email address associated with your account or one of your team members. This prevents random people from spamming your Hitask account with new tasks.<br> If you want to be able to send yourself tasks from additional email accounts simply add those addresses as contacts.<br>\

timer.p1=\
Record exactly how much time you spent on a task with the help of the timer. Start the timer when you start working on a task and stop when you are finished. The time spent will be recorded in your task details.<br/>\
To use the timer, first click 'Modify' and enable time tracking for your task:<br/>\
<img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="/img/help/timer-enable.png" alt="" width="276" height="258" /><br/>\
Now expand the task and click <strong>Start timer</strong>:<br/>\
<img src="/img/help/timer-start.png" alt="" width="424" height="166" /><br/>\
The timer window will appear in menu bar:<br/>\
<img src="/img/help/timer-popup.png" alt="" width="345" height="188" /><br/>\
It displays hours and minutes in HH:MM format. Initially it will show 00:00, after a minute it will be 00:01 and so on. Blinking colon ":" means that the timer is running.<br/>\

</p>\
<h1>It's secure!</h1>\
<p>\
Your files are safe. Files are stored on a secure server and accessed only through HTTPS/SSL secure connection. Files can be accessed only by you or people you share them with.\
</p>\
<h1>Your file storage size</h1>\
<p>\
Your storage size depends on what kind of account you have:<br/>\
</p>\
<h2>Business account</h2>\
<p>Business accounts have 2.5GB of file storage per user license. This means if you have 5 user licenses in your account you have 12.5GB of storage.<br/>\
All business account members share same storage quota: files uploaded by any team member will use up the common quota for the team account.<br/>\
</p>\
<h2>Premium accounts</h2>\
<p>\
Premium accounts have 1GB of file storage.<br/>\
</p>\
<h2>Free accounts</h2>\
<p>\
Free users receive 50MB of file storage. To get more storage upgrade to a Premium or Business account.\
</p>\



timetracking.p1=\
With Time tracking, you can create records showing time spent on a particular day or on a particular task. You, or any of your team members, are able to log time on a task.<br/>\

To track time for a particular task, you first need to enable the time tracking feature when modifying or creating the item. Simply enable the time tracking checkbox located below start and end date and reminder settings.<br/>\
<img src="/img/help/time-tracking-enable.gif" border="0" alt="" /><br/>\
To manually enter time spent on a task, expand the task and click on Log Time:<br/>\
<img src="/img/help/time-tracking-logtime.gif" border="0" alt="" /><br/>\
You can enter time in various formats. Entering any number means how many hours you have spent. You may use decimal numbers like 0.5 (half an hour or 30 minutes). You can also write "hour" "minutes" "h" "m", e.g. "1 hour 30 minutes", "1h 30m".<br/>\
Once you have logged some hours you can see the time log by clicking on the "Details..." link in an expanded task.\



autofill.p1=\
You can automate certain information when typing in the Task Title field.  Dates and times can be designated in the Task Title, which means fewer clicks for you!<br/>\
<p>For example, if you enter "Today 8am" in the Title\
<img src="img/help/autofill1.png"/><br/>\
Your task will be automatically set to 8am!\
<br/>\
<img src="img/help/autofill2.png"/></p>\
<ul>\
<li><b>Time Formats:</b> 8am, 8pm, 08:00, 20:00</li>\

</ul>\
<br/>\

autocreate.p1=\
You can associate tasks with projects and create new tags when typing in the Task Title field, which means fewer clicks for you!\
<ul>\
<li><b>Tags:</b> Add the hash mark '#' before a word that you want to associate the task with.  If there is not an existing tag, a new one will be made.</li>\
<img src="img/help/newtag1.png"/><br/>\
And a new tag is automatically created!\
<br/>\
<img src="img/help/newtag2.png"/>\
<br/>\
<li><b>Projects:</b> To add a task to an existing project, add the '@' mark and the Project Name within the Task Title.</li>\
<img src="img/help/newproject1.png"/><br/>\
And your new task is now in an existing project.<br/>\
<br/>\
<img src="img/help/newproject2.png"/><br/>\
<br/>\
Using these features will help create and identify tasks more quickly.\
</ul>\
